<p>The Basic Laboratory Information System, BLIS, is a freeware Web-based system that can be installed in a local,
          district, or national laboratory. It is a tool that can help to standardize data, which improves the ability to run
          useful reports and can both give a realistic picture of laboratory services and assist with staff and budget planning.
          With enough data, BLIS can be used to track disease prevalence over time 
          Features of BLIS include:
          One-time entry of each unique patient
          Standardization of data collected (allowable entries for specimen type, test type, patient data, reagents are
          set at MOH level and then entered consistently throughout a country)
          Customization to a country's needs
          Ability to track lab supplies such as test kits, reagents
          Ability to run reports as specified by a country 
          Automatic alerting of data values that may be out of range(reference ranges and panic values are set at the
          regional or national level)
          Daily logs to be reviewed for data verification
          Simple data backup 
          As with any properly implemented electronic record system, BLIS may be found over time to improve data
          accuracy and reduce costs in laboratories. Benefits already seen in labs using BLIS:
          Reduced burden for technicians, as results are available soon after testing
          Improved consistency of data entry
          Ability to view patient history and track samples
          Ability to aggregate data and analyze data patterns and trends at a regional or national level
          Printed patient records in place of handwritten records
          Printed daily logs that make the reports look like the paper forms used in the laboratory</p>
